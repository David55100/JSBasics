// Objects

// 1. Create an object called animal. Make sure the animal has the following
// keys. (species, name, age, gender, favoriteFood) Also, give the animal a
// method of speech that returns a string that displays what the animal says.

// 2. Create a function called findAge that takes in an object and returns the
// age key value.

// 3. Create a function called getKeys that takes in an object and returns all
// of the key names (not values!).

// 4. Create a function called changeName that takes in an object and a name
// value and replaces the object name with the given name value. Return the new object.

// 5. Create a function called speechMaker that takes in an object and returns
// the response from calling the speech method.

// 6. Create a function called addKey that takes in an object and adds a new key
// name bedtime and assigns it a value. Return the object.

// 7. Create a function called keyLoop that takes in an object and loops through
// each of the key values. If any of the key values are equal to "monkey", then
// return "There's a monkey!", otherwise return "There's no monkey here!".

// Intermediate Arrays and Objects

// 1. Create an array called cars of 3 objects of 3 different cars with the key
// names of make, model, year.

// 2. Create a function called findModels that takes in an array, loops through
// the array and returns an array of all of the model values of each object.
